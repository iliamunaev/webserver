Birds build the most amazing nests. Below, I pick out a few master bird builders and explore the techniques they use to build the perfect homes.

Like most people, I get the urge to tidy up my garden in spring, but I’ve learned not to tackle the cobwebs that knot up the corners of my greenhouse until I’m sure the long-tailed tits have finished with them. These dainty pink and grey birds weave a soft, delicate nest out of lichen, moss, or sheep’s wool and then stitch it together with cobwebs so that the nests can expand as their chicks grow.
